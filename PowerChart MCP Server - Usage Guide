# PowerChart MCP Server - Usage Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the PowerChart MCP server for automating interactions with the PowerChart electronic health record system.

## Setup

### 1. Installation

First, clone or download the repository containing the PowerChart MCP server files. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install the package
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Coordinates File

The server uses a JSON file (`coordinates.json`) that contains all the UI coordinates and screen sections. Make sure this file is in one of these locations:
- Current directory (`./coordinates.json`)
- Parent directory (`../coordinates.json`)
- Home directory (`~/coordinates.json`)
- Same directory as the script

### 3. Starting the Server

There are several ways to start the MCP server:

**Option 1: Direct execution**
```bash
python powerchart_mcp.py
```

**Option 2: Using the MCP CLI**
```bash
mcp run powerchart_mcp.py
```

**Option 3: Using the installed script (if using setup.py)**
```bash
powerchart-mcp
```

**Option 4: Registering with Claude Desktop**
```bash
mcp install powerchart_mcp.py
```

## Available Tools

The PowerChart MCP server provides the following tools:

### Navigation

- `navigate_to(section, element)`: Clicks on a specific element within a section
- `double_click_element(section, element)`: Double-clicks on a specific element
- `scroll_section(section, direction, clicks)`: Scrolls up or down within a section
- `click_patient_from_list(position)`: Clicks on a patient at a specific position in the list

### Screenshots

- `capture_screen_section(section)`: Captures a screenshot of a specific section

### Workflows

- `perform_workflow(workflow_name)`: Performs a predefined workflow

## Available Resources

The server also provides these resources:

- `coordinates://{section}`: Gets information about available coordinates for a section
- `sections://list`: Lists all available sections for navigation

## Example Usage

Here's how you can use the PowerChart MCP server with Claude or another MCP-compatible LLM:

```
# Navigate to the patient list
I'd like to open the patient list.

# Capture a screenshot of the inpatient management section
Please take a screenshot of the inpatient management section.

# Perform a workflow
Can you check the documentation for the current patient?

# Get information about available sections
What sections are available for navigation?
```

## Extending the Server

You can easily extend the PowerChart MCP server by:

1. Adding new coordinates to the `coordinates.md` file
2. Adding new screen sections to the `SCREEN_SECTIONS` dictionary
3. Creating new workflows in the `perform_workflow` function
4. Adding new tools or resources as needed

## Troubleshooting

- **Coordinate Issues**: If clicks are not landing in the correct place, verify that the coordinates in the `coordinates.md` file are correct for your screen resolution.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Make sure all required packages are installed.
- **Permission Issues**: The automation requires permission to control your mouse and take screenshots. Make sure you grant these permissions if prompted.
