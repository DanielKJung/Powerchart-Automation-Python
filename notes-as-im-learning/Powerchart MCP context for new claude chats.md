PowerChart Automation Project Summary
We've been discussing the implementation of an automation solution for PowerChart, a medical EHR system accessed through Citrix Viewer. Here's a comprehensive summary of our established goals and approach:
Current Status

You've successfully automated the login process to PowerChart via Citrix Viewer
You've established consistent window positioning and sizing
You're now looking to automate clinical workflows within PowerChart

Implementation Approach

Using coordinate-based clicking automation since PowerChart runs in a virtualized Citrix environment
Implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a framework to connect Claude to your automation system
Using screenshot capture and analysis rather than direct API integration (which would cost $5,000 annually)

Core Technical Components

Coordinate-Based Automation Framework

Calibration system for UI element positions
Click and keyboard input simulation
Reliable navigation patterns


Screenshot Capture & Analysis

Window-specific screenshot capability
OCR for basic data extraction
Claude-based intelligent extraction for complex medical data


MCP Server Implementation

Creating a server that connects Claude to your automation
Defining capabilities for patient data retrieval and interaction
Building handlers that translate Claude's requests into automation actions


Clinical Workflow Orchestration

Creating predefined workflows for common clinical tasks
Implementing flexible, adaptive execution
Building document generation capabilities



Primary Goals

Automate patient information retrieval through predefined click sequences
Capture and process clinical data through screenshots
Use Claude to synthesize and structure the data
Generate clinical documentation (problem lists, progress notes, discharge summaries)
Create a system that can adapt to variations through LLM-guided decision making

Implementation Plan
We've outlined a detailed roadmap covering:

Foundation setup and environment configuration
Coordinate-based automation development
Screenshot and data extraction capabilities
MCP server implementation
Workflow orchestration
Testing and validation
Claude integration
Reliability enhancements
Advanced features and deployment

This combination of coordinate-based automation with MCP will allow you to create an intelligent, flexible system that leverages Claude's capabilities to enhance physician workflow while working within the constraints of the Citrix environment.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
